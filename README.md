NeuroFlow Backend Coding Assessment

If this were a production application rather than an assessment, there are some things I would consider/change:
- Apply a separate login module rather than implementing one within the main mood tracking function.
- Split operations/models into separate files rather than one main file, in order to account for a larger user base.
- Utilize a separate database rather than self-inputted CSV file data for testing the API.
- Consider execution time and possible errors that may arise from incorrect input.
